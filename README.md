# Udemy Live Caption Translator

A Chrome extension that translates Udemy English video captions into Korean in real time using Chrome's built-in Translator API.

## Features

- Real-time English-to-Korean caption translation
- Uses Chrome's on-device Translator API
- No external translation API or API key required
- Replaces English captions visually with Korean captions
- Preserves Udemy's original caption DOM
- In-memory translation cache
- Automatic caption change detection
- Restores English captions when disabled
- No transcript panel required

## Requirements

- Chrome 138 or later (desktop)
- A device supporting the Chrome Translator API
- Udemy videos with English closed captions (CC)

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode.
4. Select "Load unpacked".
5. Select the repository folder.
6. Open a Udemy video and enable English CC.
7. Click "한국어 CC 시작" on the video.

The translation model may be downloaded on first use.

## How It Works

1. Detect the English caption DOM:
   `[data-purpose="captions-cue-text"]`
2. Translate caption text with Chrome Translator API.
3. Cache completed translations in memory.
4. Hide the original English text using CSS only when the Korean translation is ready.
5. Display Korean text in a separate overlay.
6. Restore English captions when translation is disabled.

## Limitations

- Currently supports English to Korean only.
- Requires existing Udemy English captions.
- Initial translations may be delayed.
- Some fullscreen player modes may not support the overlay.
- Udemy DOM changes may require maintenance.

## Privacy

Translation is performed using the browser's on-device translation capability. The extension does not send captions to a separate translation service.
